# Chemistry Utility
This is what the chemistry database application building has been for - this application serves to automate much of the possibly tedious lookups and calculations involved in general chemistry.

## Features of Finished Application
- stoichiometry
- balancing of formulae
- molarity calculations
- information lookup
- temperature conversions
- mass and volume conversions
- free energy
- gas laws
- reactivity
- entropy
- possibly some templates for common procedures like titration or gas generation measurement
